# ⚙️Setup and Installation (GitHub and Heroku)

> The site was deployed via Heroku, and the live link can be found here - [The Crypt](https://the-crypt-91228a836777.herokuapp.com/)

### Project Deployment: Heroku

#### 1. **Initial Setup on Heroku:**

* Sign up or log in to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
* On the main Heroku Dashboard, click 'New' > 'Create New App'.
* Name your project..
* Choose a suitable region and then click 'Create app'.

#### 2. **Setting Up the Database:**

* Navigate to the 'Resources' tab from the submenu.
* In the 'Add-ons' section, search for 'Heroku Postgres'.
* Select and add 'Heroku Postgres' as the database.
* Go to the 'Settings' tab, and within the 'Config Vars' section, copy the `DATABASE_URL` for later use.
  
#### 3. **Configuring Django for Deployment:**
  * Add `whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware` to the middleware in your settings.py to manage static files,
  * In settings.py - add whitenoise to the following `STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'`
  * Ensure your database is retrievable via the environment variables.
  * Similar to DB, ensure your public and private keys for stripe are added as env variables in heroku - the api key may be needed here as well.

 
#### 4. **Deploy on Heroku:**
